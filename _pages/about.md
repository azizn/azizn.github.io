I am an **Associate Professor of Computer Science** at the [College of Computing](https://computing.psu.ac.th/), [Prince of Songkla University](https://www.psu.ac.th/), Phuket Campus, Thailand. I lead the **AI-TASI** (Artificial Intelligence and Technology for Advanced Software Innovation) research group.

My research focuses on the intersection of **data science** and **software engineering**, with particular emphasis on software analytics, empirical software engineering, and applying AI/ML techniques to improve software development practices.
