I am particularly interested in data science in software engineering, including software analytics, data analytics in open source software, social analytics.  I also do research on software engineering practices in scientific software development. For example, agile methods, test-driven development, design patterns. My research extends to empirical software engineering, software quality, software maintenance, software development process, software architecture, and reverse engineering.
